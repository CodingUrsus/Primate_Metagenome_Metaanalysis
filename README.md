# Functional Metagenomic Meta-Analysis of Primate Gut Microbiomes

## Overview

This repository contains data and code for a comprehensive meta-analysis of functional metagenomic data from primate gut microbiomes. The study investigates how host evolutionary history, dietary strategy, and industrialization shape gut microbiome function and diversity. By leveraging functional annotations, phylogenetic analyses, and comparative genomics, the project illuminates key microbial traits that have co-evolved with primate hosts and highlights the influence of modern lifestyles on microbiome composition and functionality.

## Key Insights

### Functional Composition and Industrialization

The functional composition of primate gut microbiomes shows significant associations with industrialization, dietary strategy, and host taxonomy. Ordination analyses reveal clustering of microbiomes by these factors, emphasizing the interplay between host lifestyle and microbial function.

### Functional Phylosymbiosis

Functional phylosymbiosis is observed across primate taxa, where microbial functional traits mirror host evolutionary relationships. Mantel tests and phylogenetic signal analyses highlight the deep evolutionary ties between host taxa and their associated microbiomes.

### Phylogenetic Signal in Microbial Functions

Gut microbial KEGG Orthology (KO) modules exhibit significant phylogenetic signal, reflecting host lineage-specific functional adaptations. Heatmaps of KO module abundance underscore these patterns, providing a basis for exploring co-evolutionary dynamics.

### Co-Phylogenetic Patterns in Microbial Proteins

Protein family diversity within gut microbes parallels primate host phylogeny. Co-phylogenetic analyses of *Brachyspira aalborgi* and *Helicobacter sp.* protein families reveal tight evolutionary congruence with their primate hosts, suggesting long-term co-evolutionary processes.

### Phylogenetic and Functional Divergences

Phylogenetic trees with heatmap rings highlight genus-level protein family distributions, while boxplots demonstrate functional divergences in human populations compared to non-human primates. These visualizations underscore the impact of industrialization and diet on human gut microbiomes.
